# Heart Disease Prediction Demo

Demonstration of the Streamlit library for deployment of machine learning predictive models. 

The data used for the training of the model can be found on the [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease). Given the small amount of data and my lack of expertise in healthcare, the results given by the model should in no way serve as substitute for the diagnosis given by an actual medical professional.

The cleaning and training process can be found on the heartd-model.py file. Data analysis and cleaning was superficial, given that the objective was the quick deployment of a simple predictive model. The configuration of the web app can be found on the heartd-app.py
